# About Me
Hi, my name is Nathan McNulty, and I am passionate about learning and sharing how to design and implement secure solutions that provide the best user experiences possible.

I am currently a Senior Security Solutions Architect for Patriot Consulting primarily helping our clients implement Azure, M365 Defender, and MEM security and compliance solutions. Having started my career on Help Desk for a civil engineering firm, I quickly became the Enterprise Desktop Administrator and later took a role as the Client Architect for the school district of roughly 50K users where I later spent several years building our security program from scratch. I am also on the board at [Opsecedu](https://www.opsecedu.com), a community focused on building up security people serving in K12 and Higher Education. I have also worked in industrial control systems and several non-profits in addition to working with dozens of organizations from many different sectors.

# Requests
Please feel free to open an issue if you have any requests for scripts, tools, or example solutions. I also welcome PR's, especially when they fix something I broke :)
